## Parsing news from websites :newspaper:
Sending updates is done via Telegram API

This project enables you to send updates to a Telegram channel with bot. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Bot which API key you use in this project must be adminstrator of the channel which id you use. 

Furthermore, the project maintains a basic database by storing the last sent news from each website in an automatically generated corresponding _".txt"_ file.

## For the fast deploy on Linux you can try the following steps üê≥
1. Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kerensk1y/News_parser.git
```
2. Install the requiered modules:
```
pip3 install -r requierments.txt
```
3. Allow execution for `setup.sh`:
```
cd news_parser
```
```
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x bot_run.sh
chmod +x bot_stop.sh
```
4. Run setup.sh and insert the _"channel_id"_ and _"API_KEY"_ variables:
```
./setup.sh
```
5. Run the `main.py` file in the background via `bot_run.sh`:
```
nohup ./bot_run.sh &
```
For stopping the process use:
```
./bot_stop.sh
```
Alternative 5th step with only starting the process:
```
nohup python3 -u main.py &
```
Then the stopping process is:
```
kill -n 9 $(ps aux | grep News_parser/main.py | head -n 1 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
```
