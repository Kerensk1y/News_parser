# Parsing news websites
Sending updates is done in a pre-defined file in the Telegram channel called *'t0ken.py'*. It should contain two variables: *'channel_id'* (the channel identifier, including '@') and *'API_KEY'* (the key for interacting with the bot). The storage of the last sent news from each website is recorded in an automatically created corresponding *'.txt'* file as a basic database.
